# FridayAfternoonMath 📐

Welcome to FridayAfternoonMath! This repository is a fun space dedicated to exploring my curiosities in applied mathematics.

## How It Works (Or Doesn't Work) 🤷‍♂️

- I will be exploring my curiosities in applied mathematics. 

- I will be using Python to solve these problems.

- I will be using Jupyter Notebooks to document my work.


## Why the Name? 🤔

Friday afternoons are for me a good time. That is the same feeling when I am trying to answer some of my curiosities in math. So, it would be a good idea to combine the two Friday afternoons and math.

## Questions 🤔

- So many questions, so little time!
